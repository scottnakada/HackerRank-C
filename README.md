HackerRank C Programs
=====================

This repository contains samples of C code used to solve problems on the HackerRank.com web-site.
Most of the C code that I've developed as a professional, is propietary, and belongs to the companies
for whom I've worked.  So, to show some samples of my programming skills, I've written a few programs
solving problems from the HackerRank web-site.
